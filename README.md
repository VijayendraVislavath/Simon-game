# Simon Game

## Overview

The **Simon Game** is a recreation of the classic memory skill game, where the player must repeat increasingly complex sequences of flashing colors and sounds. This project is a web-based version of the game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Test your memory and see how long you can keep up with Simon!

## Features

- Interactive user interface with responsive design
- Randomly generated color sequences that increase in complexity
- Score tracker for each game session
- Sound effects for each color
- Restart and game over functionalities
- Cross-browser compatibility


## How to Play

1. The game will show a sequence of colors, starting with one.
2. Your task is to remember the sequence and repeat it.
3. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence.
4. If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game continues, and the sequence gets longer.
5. If you make a mistake, the game is over, and you can restart to play again.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simon-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simon-game
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to play the game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, user interaction, and animations.

## Future Improvements

- Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Implement high score saving using browser localStorage
- Improve animations and sound quality
- Create a mobile version with touch controls
